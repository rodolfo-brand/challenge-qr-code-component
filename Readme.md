### What I learned

I really enjoyed to try and make the content responsive in multiple screen sizes. For that i set the minimum height of body to 100% viewport height (vh), and used relative measurements, such as vh and rem on css, to ensure that the content adapts itself according to the screen size.

```css
body {
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}

.qrbox {
    max-width: 320px;
    padding: 1rem;
    border-radius: 1.25rem;
}

```

### Continued development

I would love to have some personal made qr-codes of things i created from scratch. With this challenge i perceived some gaps in my code and semantics. I hope in the future i'll be able to better organize my projects.

### Useful resources

- [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/) - I highly recommend anyone doing this challenge to learn how to use ai in your favour. I personally like Deepseek, but i`m sure that Gemini, ChatGPT, Copilot and others would be just as fine as well.

    An example of how i use deepseek is to better understand what kind of measurement should i use for my project, is it absolute or relative? How should i adress the colors on css? Hex, RGB, HSL?

    The R1 deepthink feature of deepseek is particularly useful for morre elaborate answers

- [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) - I love this operating system because it`s open source, has a good resemblance with windows, is easy to use, and for my personal favorite, has a built-in terminal to use Git.
